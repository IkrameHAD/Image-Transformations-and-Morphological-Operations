# Image-Transformations-and-Morphological-Operations
The goal of this lab session is to understand in practice:

    - How to quantitatively characterize an images, e.g. by measuring their properties
    - Compute the
    - Use morphological operations in practice put in practice some of the concepts studied during the first lecture implement several of the transformations seen during
